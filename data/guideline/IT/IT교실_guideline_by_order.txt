Structure the script as follows: Opening - Process Explanation - Ending.

In the opening, include a preview of what content will be learned today.

Explain the process, breaking it down into steps such as app description, opening the app, and making selections.

For buttons that need to be pressed, either separate them into different steps or emphasize them with a 1-second sound effect.

Create a 10 to 30-second waiting time for practice between each process explanation.

At the end of the live broadcast, schedule a 1-minute question time for class wrap-up.

In the ending, include a review of what content was learned today.
