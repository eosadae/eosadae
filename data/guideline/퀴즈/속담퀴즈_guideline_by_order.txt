During the break time, put in about 4 minutes of music, and at the end of the song, put in a comment saying "Let's meet again."

Give a brief explanation of the meaning of the word, and also add a comment about the word.

When wrapping up, let the audience know that it was a useful and enjoyable time studying idioms together, and add a feeling of "Let's meet again next time in this session."
